# Learn Go

A personal learning project for Go, coming from a JavaScript/TypeScript background.

## Project Context

This is an educational repository where I'm learning Go concepts with AI assistance. The goal is to leverage my existing JS/TS experience to understand Go idioms and patterns.

## Structure

- `main.go` - Entry point for experimenting with Go code
- `docs/` - Learning notes organized by topic
  - `00-from-js-ts.md` - JS/TS to Go ecosystem comparison
  - `01-go-modules.md` - Go module system
  - `02-dependencies.md` - Managing dependencies
  - `03-project-structure.md` - Project layout conventions
  - `04-testing.md` - Testing in Go
  - `05-tooling.md` - Go toolchain
  - `06-structs.md` - Structs and types
  - `07-pointers.md` - Pointers
  - `08-web-frameworks.md` - Web frameworks (Chi, Gin, Echo, Fiber)

## Commands

```bash
go run .          # Run the program
go build          # Compile to binary
go test ./...     # Run all tests
go fmt ./...      # Format code
go vet ./...      # Static analysis
```

## Guidelines for AI Assistance

- Compare Go concepts to JS/TS equivalents when explaining
- Show idiomatic Go patterns, not direct translations from JS
- Explain the "why" behind Go conventions (e.g., explicit error handling, capitalization for exports)
- When adding new topics, create corresponding docs in `docs/` folder with numbered prefix
- Keep code examples simple and focused on learning
